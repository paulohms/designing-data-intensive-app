# Designing Data-Intensive Applications

If you have worked in software engineering in recent years, especially in server-side
and backend systems, you have probably been bombarded with a plethora of buzz‐
words relating to storage and processing of data. NoSQL! Big Data! Web-scale!
Sharding! Eventual consistency! ACID! CAP theorem! Cloud services! MapReduce!
Real-time!

Data-intensive applications are pushing the boundaries of what is possible by making
use of these technological developments. We call an application data-intensive if data
is its primary challenge—the quantity of data, the complexity of data, or the speed at which it is changing—as opposed to compute-intensive, where CPU cycles are the
bottleneck.

The buzzwords that fill this space are a sign of enthusiasm for the new possibilities,
which is a great thing. However, as software engineers and architects, we also need to
have a technically accurate and precise understanding of the various technologies and
their trade-offs if we want to build good applications. For that understanding, we
have to dig deeper than buzzwords.
